Developers who works for testing their applications or test cases on cloud environments instead of local environments are definitely will use terminals (i.e; Linux, poweshell and Gitbash etc).

Everyday we use to work on multiple tasks at a time. some times we do refer production environments for logs and to re-produce the same issue.

On peak times, we do wants to complete the tasks as faster as possible. same time we may confuse our selves while doing the modifications/deployments.

Then, definitely will get confused. we might do changes in production environment instead local environment. this definitely creates a huge problem, production server might stop because of simple thing.

To avoid this, terminals provide adding background color to the sessions. Using that, we can identify the environment we are working on.

As i use putty mostly, i am providing steps to add background color to session.

1. Open Putty
2. Select saved session and click on load button
3. On right side category, select Colours tab
4. Go to "select a colour to adjust block", then select "Default background" option.
5. Now select modify, then select color and click OK.
6. go to session tab, click Save button.

Now its got changed to selected background color and we might avoid a simple mistakes.
