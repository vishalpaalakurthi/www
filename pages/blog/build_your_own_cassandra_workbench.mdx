This blog refer to building a simple and easy Cassandra workbench using well known and mostly used technology stack.

                     

> too lazy to do it

Above quotation saved lots of my time, increased my productivity and switched me to create this workbench.

### let's understand what is actually **Cassandra** is ?

Apache Cassandra is an open source, distributed NoSQL database that began internally at Facebook and was released as an open-source project in July 2008. Cassandra delivers continuous availability (zero downtime), high performance, and linear scalability that modern applications require, while also offering operational simplicity and effortless replication across data centers and geographies. Cassandra can handle petabytes of information and thousands of concurrent operations per second, enabling organizations to manage large amounts of data across hybrid cloud and multi cloud environments.

                   

Large companies like Google, Microsoft, Github, Instagram, Uber, Datastax other thousands of companies are  using on their own basis.

                   

Now, Coming to the key point

i as a developer using Cassandra, most of times use to logging into the terminal and executes the query. it's always kills my productivity because i have to login into terminal for executing even a simple select queries also.

Most of non-database people like me will only use database for verifying the data. i.e executes select queries only.

Then, i have decided to have my own a simple workbench where i can configure the multiple node sessions and verify the required node data.

                 

Finally after having thoughts as a back-end developer  i have chosen Datastax for their pre-built dependencies and other technology stacks like
            

- Java8
- Spring boot
- Datastax Cassandra dependencies
- Html5
- Css
- Javascript
- Thymeleaf
- Cassandra CQL (for verifying data)
- Maven build tool
